# Description: 
This is a project management system for egineering teams. 

The system will:

Track project workers by reading Project List and Worker List 
      - Overwrite/Update/Add Project/workers

Calculate if a program is over or under budget - use sub-task estimates of budget required

Calculate the estimated completion dates based off of sub-task lengths

Return how many workers are on a project

Return what project a worker is on


# Functions: 
Class "Project" with a constructor that accepts x arguments, use array "projarr" of y number of "Project" objects (also with x arguments, here x = 2)
      
      Project projarr[y=3] = {Project(A,B), Project(A,B), Project(A,B)};
      
Nest constructors/classes in order to create projects with sub tasks?

reads in a file until the end

sum sub-task budgets for project budgets and compare to budget goal, returns bool value true/false if under/over budget

sum number of workers on project and track with "Project" object

make the project name string be the first object - return first object for project name. If asked what project(s) a person is on, check array of strigs (peoples names) with == and output...

^^^ above comments made on loose understanding of how classes/constructors work. Needs work to flesh out.
